## Chat Announce Options
## Various messages to be sent to game chats.
## Uncommenting these options will enable the corresponding messages.
## By default, messages are broadcast to Game chat channels on TGS3 or non-admin channels on TGS4.
## If using TGS4, the string option can be set as a chat channel tag to limit the message
## to channels of that tag type (case-sensitive).
## For example, CHAT_ANNOUNCE_NEW_GAME chat_channel_tag.

## Welcome message sent at the start of a new round.
## Example of a notification message: "[game_id]: A new round has begun!"
MESSAGE_ANNOUNCE_NEW_GAME Round [game_id]: A new round has begun!

## Message sent at the end of a round.
## Example of a role notification message: "<@859887924223672360> The round is almost over! Get ready for the next one."
## Replace 859887924223672360 with the appropriate role ID if needed.
MESSAGE_ANNOUNCE_ROUND_END The round is almost over! Get ready for the next one.
