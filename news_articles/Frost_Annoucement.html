The Blackshield logo flashes on the news prompter before the image of a Krosian with a light gray fur pattern adorned in a sergeant uniform popped on the screen.  His attire was decorated in numerous honors related to expeditions carried out under Blackshield duty. 
<br><br>

"Greetings, This is Sergeant Frost.  The goal of this news operation first and foremost is to get eyes up here on the upper colony for surface operations."
<br>

Frost holds up a small stack of papers and sighs
</i>
<br>
"We can't get everything done under budget anymore and we’ve worked with consultants from Lonestar and a think tank of Soteria's finest budget auditors to come up with an eloquent solution to our current lack of manpower.  Truth be told, our main goal was making the surface operations as constant as can be. This over the recent times has failed more and more, thus we are trying-" *the next part is said through gritted teeth showing utter disdain* "- A field operation using pre-authorized shuttle usage."
<br>
Frost then pinches their nose and sighs before calmly showing on screen a few graphs and photos of Ameridian fissures located in dark treacherous caves, the floors and walls shimmering from the sheer amount of Ameridian across the ground.   
<br>
"As seen in our detailed reports… ...that is within bounds for public release." Frost says cold and dry "This operation's goal is to destroy a majority, if not completely erase the growth of Ameridian in this sector of Amethyn." Frost pauses a moment as a new chart and Soteria’s logo appears next to a hypothesis paper [Of Ameridian in Local Caves and Growths connection to the planetary fissures] "According to studies from Soteria, doing so will lead to a decrease in Ameridian growths inside Lonestar Shipping caves and in the local surface forest for some time."

Frost then puts the report on top of the bundle before moving the stack from one side to the other, facing the camera to complete their brief.

<br>
<br>
"This will be the first of hopefully many joint operations between the surface employees and Blackshield Expedition Intel Teams."

The ending of the news segment is a jumpcut to a Blackshield logo before slowly fading out as credits of different sources and scientists scroll quickly and disclaimers about the study are released
